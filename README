Introduction
============

BTSender is a package that will act as an automatic file pusher
that sends a list of files to any detectable BlueTooth devices in
the vicinity. 


Compatibility
=============

There are three required libraries to use this package, BlueZ [bluez],
PyBlueZ [pybluez] and openobex [openobex].


Installation
============

Unpack the file. This is typically accomplished by running::

 $ tar -xzf <archive-name>

Enter the generated directory, and then run this::

 $ python setup.py install

The package will be installed to ~/BTSender


Implementation notes
====================

The shell around the core sending functions is implemented in
Python, while the actual sending, which uses the obex protocol, is
mostly ripped directly from ussp-push [ussp-push], only slightly
rewritten to allow it to be called directly from within python, and
other small changes to accomodate the wanted functionality.


Sample usage
============

The package is easy to use. All you have to do is go to the
installation-directory (~/BTSender). There you type::

 $ ./start.sh

This will setup an important environment variable so the program
will find the libraries, and start BTSender.

Once running, it will search for any nearby BlueTooth devices and
send them the files. Any files in the files subdirectory will be
pushed out, so if there are files in there you don't want to send
they will have to be deleted or moved out. Likewise, if there are
new files you want to push out, put them in this directory, and
all detected devices will get this file as well.


Test suite
==========

Running the unit tests should be a simple matter of running::

 $ python unittests.py

Although, if you haven't already run the program beforehand, you
should setup the variable that the start.sh script does. To do
this manually, simply type::

 $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib


Documentation generation
========================

An HTML version of the documentation in this file may be produced
using docutils, like this::

 $ rst2html README >README.html

or a LaTeX version like this::

 $ rst2latex README >README.tex
